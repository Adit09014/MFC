Time Complexity of:-
1) Bubble sort:- O(n^2) in the worst and average case and O(n) in the best case.
2) Selection Sort:- O(n^2) in the worst,average and best case. 
3) Insertion Sort:- O(n^2) in the worst and average case and O(n) in the best case.

So Bubble and insertion sort are better than selection sort.
Between Bubble and insertion, insertion sort is better algorithm for sorting.
